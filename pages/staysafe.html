              <h2>CPR: A Real Lifesaver</h2>
              <strong>What Is CPR?</strong> CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) is a way to help a person who has
              stopped breathing, and whose heart may have stopped beating, to stay alive. "Cardio" is about the heart
              and "pulmonary" is about the lungs. "Resuscitation" means "revive." <br>
              <strong>What Happens During CPR?</strong> The person giving CPR — called a rescuer — follows three main
              steps, which are known as
              <ul>
                which are known as C-A-B:
                <li>A: Check the airway.</li>
                <li>B: Do rescue breathing.</li>
                <li>C: Do chest compressions.</li>
              </ul> <br>
              <strong>What Are Chest Compressions?</strong> The rescuer presses on the person's chest many times in a
              row to move blood out of the heart that has stopped beating.<br>
              <strong>What Is Checking the Airway?</strong> The rescuer, after doing 30 chest compressions, checks the
              airway by listening and looking to see if the person is breathing.<br>
              <strong>What Is Rescue Breathing?</strong> Rescue breathing helps to move oxygen, which everyone needs to
              live, down into the lungs of the person who isn't breathing. If the person is not breathing, TWO rescue
              breaths are given.<br>
              <strong>When Should Someone Use CPR?</strong> The steps in CPR (compressions, airway, and breathing)
              should be used whenever someone is not breathing and when their heart is not beating.<br>
              <strong>Nosebleeds</strong>Most nosebleeds look worse than they are. In other words, nosebleeds are messy,
              a little uncomfortable, and sometimes even scary, but they're usually no big deal. A kid might get
              nosebleeds just once in a while or more often. The nosebleeds that are most common in kids usually happen
              near the front of the nose, on the wall separating the two sides of the nose (the septum), and usually
              start from just one nostril. Sometimes nosebleeds start farther back in the nose, but this is rare and
              mostly happens in older people or those who have high blood pressure or injuries to their nose or
              face.<br>
              <strong>if You Get a Nosebleed </strong> You Get a Nosebleed You know that you should see a doctor if your
              nosebleed was caused by an injury, such as a punch. But what if it just starts bleeding on its own? Follow
              these steps:
              <ul>
                <li> Don't lie down. Sit up or stand.</li>
                <li> Use tissues or a damp washcloth to catch the blood.</li>
                <li> Tip your head forward. Don't lean your head back; this can make blood run down your throat.</li>
                <li>Pinch the soft part of your nose together (just below the bony part of your nose) and breathe
                  through your mouth. Do this for 10 minutes. Make sure you hold the pressure for 10 minutes without
                  stopping. It seems like a long time when you actually do it, so having someone check the time may
                  help.</li>
                <li>if your nosebleed doesn't stop after 10 minutes of pressure, pinch it for another 10 minutes. If it
                  still hasn't stopped, your mom, dad, or another adult should talk to a doctor.
                </li>
                <li>Do not pick, rub, or blow your nose — this can make your nose bleed more.</li>
              </ul> <br>
              <strong>When Should I See a Doctor?</strong> Your parent should call the doctor or take you to the
              emergency department if :
              <ul>
                <li>You feel dizzy, weak, or faint (like you might pass out).</li>
                <li>Your nose is bleeding fast or you seem to be losing a lot of blood.</li>
                <li>You just started taking a new medicine.</li>
                <li>You have other symptoms, such as unusual bruising on your body.</li>
                <li>You are bleeding for a long time after you get hurt.</li>
                <li>You are bleeding from other areas of your body, such as your gums.</li>
              </ul> <br>
